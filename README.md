## ‚ö° EM Waves in Rocket Communication

### 1. What Are Transmission Lines?

- Special cables or structures that **carry EM signals** (data or power).  
- Examples: coaxial cables, microstrip lines, and waveguides.

### 2. Types of Transmission Lines in Rockets

- **Coaxial cables**: Used for RF signal transmission.  
- **Rectangular waveguides**: Used in high-power microwave systems.  
- **Stripline or microstrip**: Printed on PCBs in avionics.  

### 3. Coaxial Cables and Waveguides Inside PSLV

- Coaxial cables carry telemetry signals from sensors to onboard computers.  
- Waveguides transmit high-frequency signals between communication modules.  

### 4. Signal Routing and Data Transfer in Avionics

- The **avionics bay** in PSLV uses transmission lines to send control commands, health checks, and telemetry data.  
- Fast and low-loss communication is key during launch.

### 5. How Antennas on PSLV Use EM Waves

- EM waves are transmitted and received by onboard **telemetry antennas**.  
- These antennas ensure PSLV stays connected with ground stations.  

### 6. Role of Resonators and Filters

- Inside RF circuits, **resonators** ensure only specific frequencies pass.  
- Used in filters, oscillators, and frequency synthesizers.  

### 7. Telemetry and Tracking Using EM Waves

- PSLV sends real-time data (speed, altitude, temperature, etc.) using telemetry systems.  
- Ground stations track the rocket using RF beacons and antennas.
